apt-get install php5 (depends on latest version).
2. Install PHP Development Framework
apt-get install php5-dev (depends on latest version).
3. Install php-pear (PHP Extension and Application Repository), needed to install php extensions
apt-get install php-pear
4. Install Tool command language (TCL) and TK, it is necessary for installing expect package

apt-get install tk tk-dev
5. Install Expect package which will be needed in building php-expect

6. Install php-expect using pecl, 
pecl install expect
Sometime it may give error regarding channel, then use the path mentioned in the suggestion like
pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/expect-0.3.1
After successful installation of expect package, add the following line under extension in php.ini file (this will also be shown after successful installation of expect function)   	
extension = expect.so
Note: These installation steps are tested in Ubuntu version 12.04LTS and greater.

Setting up system in Fedora/Centos before installing NETCONF PHP APIs
1. Install PHP and its Development Framework

Before installing NETCONF PHP APIs make sure your system has all the requirements. 
1. wget  -O /default/path/of/php/netconf-php-master.zip https://github.com/Juniper/netconf-php/archive/master.zip 
(usually default path of php is /usr/share/php)
2. unzip netconf-php-master.zip
3. rm  -r netconf-php-master.zip (Optional)
include this path in your API for device.php or other API classes.
For example while writing your code, include path 
include(“netconf-php-master/netconf/Device.php”)
                                     or 
include(“netconf-php-master/netconf/XML.php”)
